# test repo for gate issue 2

[github.com/SergiusIW/gate/issues/2](https://github.com/SergiusIW/gate/issues/2)

## mixer_demo

This proves that this isn't a version issue with the SDL2 crate v0.29 (used by gate) and v0.31 (current).

`cargo run --example mixer_demo <path/to/some_ogg_file.ogg>`

Currently set to use SDL2 v0.29 (see `Cargo.toml`)

## test harness for mixer calls in gate

TBD
